# CentOS-AD-Authentication
In this repo, you'll find all the configuration files to integrate a CentOS server into an Active Directory,
using AD users to connect on Linux. You'll also find a shell's script to make Active Directory users home directory.
You can use this script on crontab to check new users all hours. This configuration was used in my society to make a
vsFTPd server using AD credentials, instead of creating specially a UNIX account for each user of the society.
